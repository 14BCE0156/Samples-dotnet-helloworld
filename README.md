# Samples-dotnet-helloworld
This is a simple hello world example to show a .NET connection to InterSystems IRIS. It retrieves and outputs sample petstore data that has been pre-loaded into your instance of InterSystems IRIS.


## Run this sample
In the integrated terminal window type:  
    `cd /home/project/Samples-dotnet-helloworld/Simple`  
    `dotnet run`  
	
This outputs data about the first 5 birds stored within InterSystems IRIS.
	
> To see another example .NET and InterSystems IRIS, take a look at the [.NET Multimodel](../quickstarts-multimodel-dotnet/README.md) example (TO DO: ADD link) or continue to work with the pre-loaded petstore data.
