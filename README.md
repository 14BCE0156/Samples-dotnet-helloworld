# Samples-dotnet-helloworld
This is a simple hello world example to show a .NET connection to InterSystems IRIS. It retrieves and outputs sample petstore data that has been pre-loaded into your instance of InterSystems IRIS.


## Run the sample
In the integrated terminal window type: 

* `cd /home/project/Samples-dotnet-helloworld`  
* `dotnet run`

	
This outputs data about the first 5 birds stored within InterSystems IRIS.
	
## Keep Exploring
* To see another example of .NET and InterSystems IRIS, take a look at the [.NET Multimodel](../quickstarts-multimodel-dotnet/README.md) example.
* Or, continue to work with the pre-loaded petstore data.
